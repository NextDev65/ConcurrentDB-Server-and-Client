test case 1:
Open 4 terminals in different servers. 1 for server and 3 for clients
1. tc1_ct1 and tc1_ct2  contains only put operations. 
Run two clients  parallely with these testcases as input (one for each, use redirection <). 
(Use 'at' command to synchronize program executions.)
{prompt} dbclient<tcl_ct1
{prompt} dbclient<tcl_ct2
All puts should be successful
2. tc1_ct3 contains only get operation. Input to client 3. All get ops should be successful.
3. tc1_ct1d and  tc1_ct2d only deletes.
Run two clients 1 and 2 parallely with these testcases as input (one for each, use redirection <). 
All deletes should be successful
4. Repeat 2. All get should fail.
